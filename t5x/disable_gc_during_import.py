"""Disables gc during each top-level import.

Only takes effect when environment variable
EXPERIMENTAL_DISABLE_GC_DURING_IMPORT
is true.

Some libraries like SeqIO have lots of side-effects during import time.
In some cases, disabling garbage collection for each top-level import can save
minutes of startup time.

This should be _relatively_ safe, because we don't expect that it's often that
1. There's sufficient memory pressure during an import to cause an OOM, and
2. That memory pressure would have been sufficiently alleviated by garbage
   collection.
