  """Temperature sampling for language model generation.

  The temperature sampling is performed `num_decodes` times in a vectorized
  manner by expanding the batch dimension. This is similar to how beam search
  expands the batch dimension to process each batch element with multiple beams.

  This function dynamically updates the `inputs` array by sampling from the
  model logits, which is provided by `tokens_to_logits` callable. The input
  sequences are expanded at the end, populated and sliced by dropping the first
  position.

  If `inputs` has non-zero entries, those values are not modified, i.e.,
  the sampled values for those positions are discarded. This simulates the
  teacher forcing on the prefix positions.

  There are a few important observations related to this function.

  1. The `inputs` is assumed to be a non-packed sequence.

  2. If `initial_index=None`, then `inputs`[:, 0] is ignored. We will use 0 as a
     BOS token to start the generation. This inherently assumes that `inputs` is
     already shifted to the right by one position. If `initial_index=an_array`,
     the token values at `inputs`[:, initial_index] are used as the token to
     start the generation.

  3. The loop index, i, is a vector of shape [batch_size]. When beginning
     generation from scratch, each value will always have the same value. When
     beginning with a partially filled cache, the loop index of different
     elements can differ, via providing a value for `initial_index`.

  3. Unless all batch elements generated the eos_id before reaching the end, we
     always make `max_decode_len = inputs.shape[1]` number of calls to
     `tokens_to_logits` when decoding from scratch and
     `max_decode_len - jnp.minimum(initial_index)` number of calls when starting
     from a partially filled cache.

  4. Let `output` be the output sequences, i.e.,`sequences`[:, 1:]. Then
     `output`[:, j] are the tokens generated when the while loop counter `i =
     j`.  Therefore, we generate the last token when `i = max_decode_len - 1`
     and exit the while loop as all `i`s are incremented to `max_decode_len`.

  5. Once `eos_id = 1` is generated, the subsequent predictions are all replaced
     by padding token 0.

  6. When using a partially filled cache, different batch elements can have
     different lengths. This means an input that has a longer input will have
     fewer steps until its `i` value reaches `max_decode_len` than an input with
     a shorter input. We keep these longer examples alive, doing busy work
     continually overwriting a new garbage token at the end of the sequence
     until shorter examples finish.

  7. When using a partially filled cache, providing a value for `initial_index`,
     the attention cache index should be a vector of [batch_size].

  We show three examples to illustrate how this function works. In addition to
  input and output of the function, we also show two intermediate values:
  `expanded_prompt_inputs` and `final_sequences`. Also for simplicity, the
  examples are limited to `num_decodes = 1` usage and the `num_decodes`
  dimension is omitted.

  ```
  Example 1:
                   inputs = [0, 5, 6, 1, 0]
   expanded_prompt_inputs = [0, 5, 6, 1, 0, 0]
          final_sequences = [0, 5, 6, 1, a, b]  # before slicing.
                   output = [5, 6, 1, a, b]
    where `a` is prediction while taking 1 as input and `b` is prediction while
    taking `a` as input.

  Example 2 (early stopping):
                    inputs = [[0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    expanded_prompt_inputs = [[0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
           final_sequences = [[0, 5, 1, a, b,   c=1, 0, 0],
                              [0, 8, d, e, f=1, g=0, 0, 0]]
                    output = [[5, 1, a, b,   c=1, 0, 0],
                              [8, d, e, f=1, g=0, 0, 0]]

    In this example, there are two sequences. Let's look at sequence 0. The
    first generated token is `a`, which is in turn used to generate `b`.
    Finally, `c = 1` is generated with the input `b`. Then the loop terminates
    early because 1 is the `eos_id`.

    Now consider sequence 1. The when `f = 1` was generated, it is considered
    done. Since sequence 0 is not done at this point, the next prediction, i.e.,
    `g` is zerod out. This continues until the end.

  Example 3 (prefilled cache):
                    inputs = [[0, 5, 2, 6, 1, 0],
                              [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
    expanded_prompt_inputs = [[0, 5, 2, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
         max_decode_length = 6
   i = [4, 2]
              input_tokens = [[1],
                              [1]]
             output_tokens = [[a],
                              [b]]
    expanded_prompt_inputs = [[0, 5, 2, 6, 1, a, 0, 0],
                              [0, 8, 1, b, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
   i = [5, 3]
              input_tokens = [[a],
                              [b]]
             output_tokens = [[c],
                              [d]]
    expanded_prompt_inputs = [[0, 5, 2, 6, 1, a, c, 0],
                              [0, 8, 1, b, d, 0, 0, 0]]
   i = [6, 4]
              input_tokens = [[c],
                              [d]]
             output_tokens = [[y],
                              [e]]
    expanded_prompt_inputs = [[0, 5, 2, 6, 1, a, c, y],
                              [0, 8, 1, b, d, e, 0, 0]]
   i = [6, 5]
              input_tokens = [[z],
                              [e]]
             output_tokens = [[z],
                              [f]]
    expanded_prompt_inputs = [[0, 5, 2, 6, 1, a, c, z],
                              [0, 8, 1, b, d, e, f, 0]]
   i = [6, 6]
    exit
                   outputs = [[5, 2, 6, 1, a, c],
                              [8, 1, b, d, e, f]]

    In this example, there are two sequences with different input lengths. Thus
    the two caches had been filled to different positions. As we decode, the
    first sequence hits the max decode length before the second. In order to
    avoid prematurely ending decoding for the second sequence, the first
    sequence continually overwrites the final token.

  Example 4 (prefilled cache and max decode steps):
                    inputs = [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    expanded_prompt_inputs = [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
                              [0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
           initial_indices = [1, 2]
           max_decode_step = 2

   Then `max_decode_len = [3, 4]`.
   i = [1, 2]
              input_tokens = [[2],
                              [4]]
             output_tokens = [[a],
                              [b]]
    expanded_prompt_inputs = [[0, 2, a, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
                              [0, 3, 4, b, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
   i = [2, 3]]
              input_tokens = [[a],
                              [b]]
             output_tokens = [[c],
                              [d]]
    expanded_prompt_inputs = [[0, 2, a, c, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
                              [0, 3, 4, b, d, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    This is the last while loop iteration with i == max_decode_len - 1.
                   outputs = [[2, a, c, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
                              [3, 4, b, d, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```

  Args:
    inputs: array: [batch_size, max_decode_len] int32 sequence of tokens.
    cache: flax attention cache.
    tokens_to_logits: fast autoregressive decoder function taking single token
      slices and cache and returning next-token logits and updated cache.
    eos_id: int: end-of-sentence token for target vocabulary.
    decode_rng: JAX PRNGKey.
    num_decodes: number of decoded sequences to be returned.
    temperature: float: sampling temperature factor. As it approaches zero this
      becomes equivalent to greedy sampling.
    topk: integer: if nonzero only use the top-k logits to sample next token, if
      zero don't use any cutoff and sample from full logits over vocabulary.
    topp: float: if nonzero only use the smallest number of logits whose
      cumulative sum of probs adds up to (at least) topp. Will raise ValueError
      if it's nonzero when topk is nonzero.
    cache_offset: axis offset for cache, arising from scanned layers.
    initial_index: Optional[array]: [batch_size] int32 a vector of loop indexes
      to start decoding at.
    max_decode_steps: int: an optional maximum number of decoding steps. If
      None, it will decode until the full input shape `inputs.shape[1]` is
      filled. max_decode_steps begins counting after the prompt, so it will
      decode at most len(prompt) + max_decode_steps tokens.
    max_decode_steps_hard_limit: int: an optional fixed hard limit on
      max_decode_steps. If this is set (not None and > 0), and max_decode_steps
      is also set, then max_decode_steps will be clipped to this limit. The
      value max_decode_steps can be an ndarray, but max_decode_steps_hard_limit
      must be a Python integer or None.
    rescale_log_probs: bool: whether to apply temperature, topp, and topk
      rescaling to the log probs which are returned. If True, the log_probs will
      include these transformations (for example, with topk=1, all log_probs
      will be identically 0.0). If False, the log_probs will not be affected,
      and topk/topp/temperature will not affect sequence probabilities.
    state_callback_fn: Function that modifies the sampling loop state before
      each step. This can be used to manipulate any part of the state either on
      the accelerator or on the host using host callback. The function should
      take a SamplingLoopState as argument, and it returns the updated state.
      See `decoding_test.py` for an example usage.
    logit_callback_fn: Function that modifies the logits before each temperature
      sampling step. The function should take arguments (logits, state) and it
      should return the modified logits. See `decoding_test.py` for an example
      usage.

  Returns:
    A tuple (decodes, log_prob) where `decodes` is sampled sequences with shape
    [batch_size, num_decodes, max_decode_len] sorted by `log_prob`, which is log
    probability of each of the sampled sequences.
