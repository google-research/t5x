This directory contains model implementations for the T5-variants (T5.1.1,
T5.1.0, mT5, ByT5). All variants share the neural network implementation in
`network.py`, which has a minimal set of configurables in `TransformerConfig`.

Refer to the [main
README](https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/README.md) for the example usages.
