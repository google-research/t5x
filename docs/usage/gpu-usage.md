# GPU Scripts and Usage

# Warning!
An updated version of T5x with optimized GPU performance (18-80% perf gains!) and new features, including FP8 with [Transformer Engine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) and H100 support can be found here: [NVIDIA Rosetta](https://github.com/NVIDIA/JAX-Toolbox/tree/main/rosetta/rosetta/projects/t5x). 
-----
**NVIDIA no longer recommends using this repository and won't be updating it further.**
-----

The [t5x/contrib/gpu/scripts_gpu](../../t5x/contrib/gpu/scripts_gpu) directory contains scripts optimized for GPU usage and includes FP8 support via [Transformer Engine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine).

Install with `pip install -r pile_requirements.txt` to get all pile dependencies.

## Building the container
We provide a fully built and ready-to-use container here: [ghcr.io/nvidia/t5x:te-fp8-reference](ghcr.io/nvidia/t5x:te-fp8-reference)  
If you'd like you build your own,
The Dockerfile in `t5x/contrib/gpu` will build a container with all gpu/pile dependencies. It can be built with `t5x/contrib/gpu/docker/build.sh <name>` 

## Running interactively
Note: this should only be done with singlenode jobs and/or for downloading the pile. Use `t5x/contrib/gpu/docker/interactive_pull_and_launch.sh`. This takes arguments for the URL to pull a container from and the location of the dataset directory to mount. For example:

`t5x/contrib/gpu/docker/interactive_pull_and_launch.sh [URL] /my/dataset/dir`

## Downloading The Pile
We use The Pile for our pretraining experiments. If you would like to as well, run `download_the_pile.py` to download it. The download is approximately 1TB. It will download to the directory set in the environment variable: `TFDS_DATA_DIR`. After that, set the `TFDS_DATA_DIR` to the same directory in your scripts to use.

## Single Node runs
Pretraining and Finetuning can be done with `singlenode_*.sh`. These will build a T5X model with the Adam optimizer and relevant parameters. These will allow multi-gpu on one host.

## Multi Node runs
For a SLURM+pyxis cluster, `example*.sub` files provide example slurm submit files (edit with your details), which call `multiprocess*.sh` to execute training. You can add a binding script in the `.sub` file for your cluster, or remove it entirely (dropping some throughput)

## Convergence and performance
For our Pile convergence runs, we used a Global batch size of 2304 for XXL and 2016-2048 for all other models, where GBS is defined as #GPUs * BS/GPU / Tensor Parallel(TP). Below are example (tested) hardware topologies on NVIDIA DGX A100 (8x A100-SXM4-80G) and H100-SXM-80G nodes.

Note: Convergence (as shown in log) was not necessarily done with the hardware topology listed, but the listed topology is tested. Estimated Walltime is calculated assuming full throughput (seq/sec) continuously. In practice, there are compilation overheads at the beginning of each run/restart(in cluster settings) + checkpointing overheads (if any).

Other hyperparameters are specified in the associated pile `gin` files in the `contrib/gpu/t5/t5_1_1/examples` directory.

## Pretraining run commands

### Multinode
Arguments are set by environment variable as such:

`PREC={PRECISION} T5_SIZE={SIZE} BSIZE_PER_GPU={BSIZE} ..... sbatch -N {NODE_CT} t5x/contrib/gpu/t5/scripts_gpu/example_slurm_pretrain_pile.sub {GPUS_PER_NODE}`

All parameters can be found in the relevant script.

### Example Pretraining Commands
Assumes 8GPU 80GB A100/H100 Nodes. `ENABLE_FP8` uses transformer engine (included in container) and requires H100

* Note: To use, FP8 set `ENABLE_FP8` to `1`. This will automatically set `PREC` to `bfloat16` as is required by internals for `FP8` usage.
#### [T5-v1.1-small](../t5/t5_1_1/small.gin) (60M):
```sh
PREC=bfloat16 T5_SIZE=small BSIZE_PER_GPU=256 TRAIN_STEPS=1000000 NUM_MICROBATCHES=1 ENABLE_FP8=1 TP_SIZE=1 \
sbatch -N1 t5x/contrib/gpu/t5/scripts_gpu/example_slurm_pretrain_pile.sub
```

#### [T5-v1.1-large](../t5/t5_1_1/large.gin) (770M):
```sh
PREC=bfloat16 T5_SIZE=large BSIZE_PER_GPU=32 TRAIN_STEPS=1000000 NUM_MICROBATCHES=1 ENABLE_FP8=1 TP_SIZE=1 \
sbatch -N8 t5x/contrib/gpu/t5/scripts_gpu/example_slurm_pretrain_pile.sub
```

#### [T5-v1.1-xl](../t5/t5_1_1/xl.gin) (3B):
```sh
PREC=bfloat16 T5_SIZE=large BSIZE_PER_GPU=8 TRAIN_STEPS=1000000 NUM_MICROBATCHES=1 ENABLE_FP8=1 TP_SIZE=1 \
sbatch -N 32 t5x/contrib/gpu/t5/scripts_gpu/example_slurm_pretrain_pile.sub
```

### Example Finetuning Commands
Finetuning commands simply change the script and have an additional `{FT_TASK}` as the first argument (along with relevant hyperparameter changes). Your `MODEL_DIR` should contain the pretrained checkpoint to restore from.

#### MNLI v2:
```sh
FT_TASK=mnli2 PREC=bfloat16 T5_SIZE={SIZE} BSIZE_PER_GPU={BSIZE} NUM_MICROBATCHES=1 ENABLE_FP8=1 TP_SIZE=1 \
sbatch -N{NODE_CT} t5x/contrib/gpu/t5/scripts_gpu/example_slurm_ft_frompile.sub
```

#### SQuAD v1.1:
```sh
FT_TASK=squad1 PREC=bfloat16 T5_SIZE={SIZE} BSIZE_PER_GPU={BSIZE} NUM_MICROBATCHES=1 ENABLE_FP8=1 TP_SIZE=1 \
sbatch -N{NODE_CT} t5x/contrib/gpu/t5/scripts_gpu/example_slurm_ft_frompile.sub

```

## Performance Settings:
There are 3 major performance settings: `ENABLE_FP8`, `FUSE_QKV` and `TRANSPOSE_BS` (all of which are controllable via env var in the commands above).
We recommend always enabling `TRANSPOSE_BS` (default), but only using `FUSE_QKV` when using `ENABLE_FP8` for optimal performance.

On all finetuning runs, we use a Global Batch Size of 256 with bfloat16 precision + FP8.

WARNING: Finetuning is configured by default to save every checkpoint and delete none (to avoid accidentally deleting your pretrained checkpoint). Watch your disk space! This behavior can be changed in `t5x/configs/runs/finetune_{TASK}.gin`, however this puts the pretrained checkpoint at risk unless backed up.

### Singlenode (single process)
