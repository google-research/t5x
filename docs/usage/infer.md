# Running Inference on a Model


This page outlines the steps to run inference a model with T5X.

Refer to this tutorial when you have an existing model that you want to run
inference on. If you would like to fine-tune your model before inference, please
refer to the [fine-tuning](finetune) tutorial. If you'd like to compute
evaluation metrics for your model, please refer to the [evaluation](eval)
tutorial. You can also run evals as part of your fine-tuning run.

T5X supports a few inference modes. Please refer to the appropriate tutorial
based on your use-case:

1.  Run inference on [SeqIO Tasks/Mixtures](infer-seqio)
1.  Run inference on [TF Example files](infer-files)
